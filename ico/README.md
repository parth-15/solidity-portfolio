# ICO Project

## Project Setup

Install all needed dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Ensure your project is setup correctly by running:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Now you're all setup to begin writing tests and smart contracts! Check out the `package.json`'s scripts section for useful commands

## Technical Spec

<!-- Here you should list the technical requirements of the project. These should include the points given in the project spec, but will go beyond what is given in the spec because that was written by a non-technical client who leaves it up to you to fill in the spec's details -->

## Design Exercise Answer

<!-- Answer the Design Exercise. -->
<!-- In your answer: (1) Consider the tradeoffs of your design, and (2) provide some pseudocode, or a diagram, to illustrate how one would get started. -->

> The base requirements give contributors their SPC tokens immediately. How would you design your contract to vest the awarded tokens instead, i.e. award tokens to users over time, linearly?

npx hardhat test                 # run your tests
npm run test                     # watch for test file changes and automatically run tests
npx hardhat coverage             # generate a test coverage report at coverage/index.html
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test # run your tests and output gas usage metrics
npx hardhat node                 # spin up a fresh in-memory instance of the Ethereum blockchain
